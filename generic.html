							<p>Hi, I'm Sumeet, a passionate Unity developer with 2 years of experience in game development. I have a strong background in programming and a deep understanding of game mechanics, which allows me to create engaging and immersive experiences for players. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen eye for design and aesthetics, which helps me create visually stunning games. I am proficient in C# programming language and have experience with various game engines, including Unity and Unreal Engine. I have also worked on projects that involve virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.

								I enjoy finding creative solutions to challenges that arise during game development. I am comfortable working in an Agile environment and have experience with version control systems like Git.
								
								Apart from game development, I am also interested in exploring other areas of software development, such as web development and mobile app development. I believe that my passion for learning and growth will help me succeed in any field I choose to pursue.
								
								Overall, my passion for game development, combined with my technical skills and creativity, makes me a valuable asset to any game development team. I am excited to continue exploring new technologies and creating innovative games that leave a lasting impact on players.  </p>
